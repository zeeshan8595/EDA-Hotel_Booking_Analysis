# EDA-Hotel_Booking_Analysis
Capstone Project-1 On Hotel Bookings data set
The main objective of the presented work is to the exploratory data analysis for the hotel booking system to understand the patterns and the type of data in each feature 
and to establish certain relation between different features. It is necessary to have the better view of the data to identify different anomalies if any and to rectify 
them before passing the data to an algorithm that later improves the overall accuracy of the implemented model. The reservation 
is considered to be a contract between the customer and the hotel which gives the right to the customer to use the facility at a mutually agreed price for the future. 
There is always be a provision for customers to revoke the reservation, this privilege put the hotels at risk for guaranteeing the room availability for the willing 
customers or the hotels have to bear the cost of vacant rooms.
To reduce the risks, the hotels can impose constraints on cancellation and can introduce the overbooking strategies but both these policies can hamper the hotel 
performance.The critical analysis of the data helps to mitigate the effect of cancellation on sales
